##Introduction to the course

Hi and welcome to this course

about writing automated Unit and Integration Tests

for JavaScript.

My name is Maximillian Schwarzmuller,

and I will be your instructor in this course,

and I'm super happy to welcome you on board of this course.

Now in this course, we're going to start at the basics.

We're going to learn what exactly Automated Tests are,

and why you might want to add them to your projects.

And then of course, you're going to learn how you do that,

how you do write such Unit and Integration Tests,

and what these things actually are.

You're going to learn all of that

and some concrete examples,

so that's not just a slides only course.

The opposite is the case.

We have plenty of examples and demos,

and therefore, I would suggest that we don't waste any time,

but instead, we dive right in

and we start with the most important question,

what exactly is Testing

and what are these Unit and Integration Tests?
