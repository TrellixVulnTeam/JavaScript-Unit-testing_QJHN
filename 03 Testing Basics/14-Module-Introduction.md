Now that we learned which tools we need

and that we also already got some examples setups

where all those tools were already integrated,

or to be precise where V-test was added,

which is both a test runner and an assertion library,

or which combines both tools to be precise.

Now that we got all of this out of the way

we are going to dive into the basics of unit testing

and really automated tests in general

in this course section.

And for this

we are going to, of course, create some unit tests.

We're going to write some unit tests,

and you will learn how you write unit tests,

how you state your expectations,

how you define what a success or a failure of a test is.

And you're going to learn all about that.

You're also going to learn about a specific pattern

which you should use when writing tests,

the AAA pattern, Arrange, Act and Assert,

and you're also going to learn what you should test

and how you can organize your tests

if you're testing multiple things,

maybe all for different units.

That's all we're going to learn.

It's a lot of things we're going to explore

and therefore let's get started.
