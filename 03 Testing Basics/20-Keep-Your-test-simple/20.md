Now we did learn about this triple A pattern

in the previous lecture.

Another thing I wanna mention here

about writing good tests,

is that you wanna keep your tests simple.

This is really important to me

because it's easy to build an overly complex test,

and here it would already be a bit too much

if you start adding a bunch of numbers in here.

Of course it will still work,

there's nothing wrong with it,

but which value does it add

if you add more numbers?

Of course, if you wanna test

whether the function maybe doesn't work correctly anymore

with more numbers, then this could be a reason

but this shouldn't go into a test

that just checks

whether the numbers are summarized.

For (indistinct), it's sufficient

if you have two numbers in that array.

So you wanna keep your tests

as simple and concise as possible,

and you don't wanna make them unnecessarily complex

because you always have to think about yourself coming back

to a test after a couple of weeks,

or may be a fellow developer diving into the test

and everyone should be able to quickly understand

and important, change this test if needed.

So keep things simple as we're doing it here.

And that of course was a lot

of talking about the first test

but this is the foundation

for the entire rest of this course

and for your Testing career in general.

So now with that out of the way,

let's dig a bit deeper into tests

and let's see which other kinds of tests we could write.
